## Description

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

- I used MongoDB, Mongoose schema, MongoAtlasDB and handle routes with Express and Javascript to make this application work.
